                <p>This tree shows all {{ PhD_count }} people in our database.</p>
                <p><b>Warning</b>: the tree is VERY large.  It takes a long time to load and works best on large screens.</p>
                <p>Click on any name to see more details. Use your browser's search function to find a name (CTRL or COMMAND + F).</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> To force a network structure into a hierarchical tree, people with more than one advisor are shown under only one of their advisors. The advisor is chosen at random from the available co-advisors each time the tree is drawn. Coadvised students are labeled in red text.</p>
